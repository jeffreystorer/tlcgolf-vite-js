                      your player count is divisible by three, then you can
                      control whether to have all threesomes by choosing the
                      correct number of tee times. For example, if you have
                      twelve players, choose three times to play in foursomes or
                      four times to play in threesomes. With fifteen players,
                      choose five times to play in threesomes or four times to
                      play as a mixed group. If you sort your list by handicap
                      and then Auto Populate, you will have the lowest handicap
                      players in the first tee time, the next lowest in the

                      any device where you run the app, not just the one on
                      which you created the lineup. Also, if you make a lineup
                      one day and come back to it the next, the course handicaps
                      will be automatically updated using the players' current
                      indexes. When you click the Save Lineup button, you
                      automatically be taken to the Export page. Note that the
                      Save Lineup button will not appear until you have selected
                      a playing date, number of tee times, and link time, added
                      players to your lineup, and populated your teams.

                      When you have one or more saved Lineups, you'll see the

                      the name of a saved lineup, it will be loaded for editing
                      in the box below, with buttons to Export, Clear, or
                      Delete. Export will take you to the Export page and load
                      the lineup there. Clear will remove the current saved line
                      up and let you create a new lineup, without deleting the

                      your Saved Lineups list and delete it from the cloud
                      storage.
